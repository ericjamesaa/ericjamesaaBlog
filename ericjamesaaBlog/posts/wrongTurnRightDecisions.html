    <h2>Wrong Turn, Right Decision</h2>

        As I approach the age of 30, I still carry the mindset of my 16-year-old self—confused, impulsive, and distracted. 
        I’ve made decisions without thinking them through, and at one point, I thought my career had reached a dead end.

        Leaving the company where I worked for eight years was a roller-coaster experience. 
        For a time, I thought I could never escape the chains of agony, anxiety, and frustration. 
        Don’t get me wrong—I am grateful for joining another organization after so long. 
        They allowed me to earn an amount I once thought was impossible back in my first company. 
        But the role wasn’t my cup of tea, and I could no longer stand being in a position that left me drained, demotivated, and devalued. 
        My academic performance in graduate school also suffered—I dropped two classes, received an incomplete, and even now, I haven’t managed to finish it.
