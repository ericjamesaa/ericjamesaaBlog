    <h2>Wrong Turn, Right Decision</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">August 29, 2025</p>
    <p>
      As I approach the age of 30, I still carry the mindset of my 16-year-old self—confused, impulsive, and distracted.
      I’ve made decisions without thinking them through, and at one point, I thought my career had reached a dead end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the company where I worked for eight years was a roller-coaster experience.
      For a time, I thought I could never escape the chains of agony, anxiety, and frustration.
      Don’t get me wrong—I am grateful for joining another organization after so long.
      They allowed me to earn an amount I once thought was impossible back in my first company.
      But the role wasn’t my cup of tea, and I could no longer stand being in a position that left me drained,
      demotivated, and devalued.
      My academic performance in graduate school also suffered—I dropped two classes, received an incomplete, and even
      now, I haven’t managed to finish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing companies after such a long time was both a learning experience and an eye-opener. I realized how
      important it is to ask the right questions before accepting a role: What does a day in this job actually look
      like? Will I have the energy to balance my work with my studies? Having the support of a manager is not enough—you
      need to be good at what you do so you can still have the bandwidth for your personal goals after work hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my search, I came across a role on LinkedIn and noticed a former colleague working at that company. We
      weren’t close, but I took a shot and reached out. He asked if I wanted to be referred, and I said yes without
      hesitation—I was desperate to leave my former employer. My first application didn’t go well, though. Out of all
      times, my manager decided to call me right during my scheduled interview. Two months later, that colleague
      messaged me again and offered to refer me to his own team.
    </p>
    <p>
      After about 16 job applications, I finally received an offer from that company. I was thrilled. I didn’t even
      bargain for a higher salary because I just wanted to move forward and close the chapter with my previous employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back at my 10 months with that employer and the 3 months I spent job-hunting, here are my key takeaways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Always ask about the scope of the role—know exactly what you’ll be doing.</li>
      <li>Rejections don’t define your worth. They’re about alignment, not ability.</li>
      <li>Believe in the “burnt toast theory.” Delays and setbacks often lead you to something better than you expected.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      As cliché as it sounds, I believe even more in the saying, “things happen for a reason.” Now that I’m with a new
      employer, although it might be too soon to tell, I can say I’m genuinely happy where I am. I believe I had to go
      through that experience so I could end up in the right place—somewhere we can achieve something greater. Sometimes
      we test other routes, hoping they’ll get us to our destination faster. But not every route is the right one; some
      may even slow us down. In life’s journey, though, one choice is never the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important thing is to know where we want to go. If that means returning to the original path, don’t hesitate.
      Just don’t look back with anger or frustration—look back to learn. Because every turn, even the wrong ones,
      teaches us something we carry forward.
